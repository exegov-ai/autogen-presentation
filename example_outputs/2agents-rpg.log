game_master (to player):

You wake up inside volcano and see a big stone axe next to you.        A tooth fairy flies near you and says: 'Hello! What is your name?'        I just found your tooth under the volcanic rock.         What do you do?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
player (to game_master):

With a growl and a heavy blink, I sit up from the warm volcanic ground, my muscles sore but my instincts sharp. I grip the big stone axe beside me, its familiar weight grounding me. 

Before I can respond to the tooth fairy, a name rises from the depths of my mind. "I am Grukthar, the Storm-Smasher!" I roar, my voice echoing through the heat of the volcano. My confusion starts to fade as I feel the remnants of strength coursing through my veins.

I look at the tooth fairy, curious about this strange encounter. "What do you want with me, little sparkly creature?"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
game_master (to player):

The tooth fairy flutters closer, her tiny wings shimmering in the incandescent glow of the volcanic landscape. She regards you with wide, innocent eyes, seemingly unfazed by your imposing stature and the axe in your hand.

"I found your tooth!" she chirps excitedly, pointing to a small sparkling object that hovers in the air between you, glowing with a faint, ethereal light. "It’s not just any tooth; it's a magical tooth! You see, it holds the power to connect us to the Realm of Dreams. But there's a problem!"

Her expression shifts from excitement to worry. "A dark force has invaded the Realm, and it threatens to break through into our world! I need your help, Grukthar! You're strong, and I believe you can stop it!" 

She flits around you, her wings creating little sparks that dance in the air. "Will you help me? Together, we can save both our worlds!" 

What do you do?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
player (to game_master):

I heft my stone axe onto my shoulder, my warrior instincts kicking in. The fairy's plea resonates within me, reminding me that strength is not just about wielding an axe; it's about using that strength for a purpose. 

“Dark forces, you say?” I rumble, my brow furrowed in thought. “I have battled through fire and fury, but I've never entered a realm of dreams. What must I do, tiny one?"

I glance around the smoldering volcanic realm, assessing the dangers that might lie ahead. "Lead me to this dark force, and I shall smash it like the mountains I crush! But tell me first, what do I need to be aware of? Are there allies in this Realm of Dreams?” 

The heat of the volcano surrounding us pulses with energy, and I can feel my heart quicken with purpose. The thought of battle ignites a fire within me, stronger than the volcanic flames.
